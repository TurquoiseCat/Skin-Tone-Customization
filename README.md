# Skin-Tone-Customization

Mod for Lob Corp. Adds the ability to set whatever color you want for an agent's skin tone.

A button is added next to 'Hair' in the customization menu. Clicking it will make the hair color picker change skin tone instead.
This is the first Lob Corp mod I have made so it may not be perfect. Suggestions are welcome.

Note: Most eyes do not have the white parts filled in, so they may look odd. I have included colored in versions of all the default eyes in the release. Just place all the images in LobotomyCorp_Data\CustomData\Face\Eye_Default.
